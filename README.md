# TASK-7-LED-TOGGLE-USING-ESP32



 LED Toggle Using ESP32 Learn the workings of an ESP32. Use the Arduino IDE to code and upload the program to the ESP32. Learn to configure the IDE to upload code to an ESP32.

Components required: ESP32 development board â€“ read ESP32 Development Boards Review and Comparison 2x 5mm LED 2x 330 Ohm Resistor Breadboard Jumper wire

Steps involved: Using a microcontroller we build an LED web server that controls the working of LED. We use general input/output pins 26 and 27 and configure them to give the output. Make sure to ground the ESP32 microcontroller. The rest of the circuits are made as shown below:
After copying the code given in

 uploading it to the Arduino IDE, we modify the code by replacing it with our network credentials
 . Plug the esp32 into the computer and follow the instructions on the given resource article (stated above).
